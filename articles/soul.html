<h1>Software Soul Searching</h1>
<p class="center">by Rob Foster</p>
<p>I believe the products we make have a soul.</p>
<p>But first, a case study.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I became frustrated by my inability to control my spending. My wife and I had gotten to where we had a small savings and our consumer debt was paid off. But we still found ourselves spending too much of each paycheck. I decided I had to figure out how to create a budget and stick with it.</p>
<p>Since it‚Äôs older than the hills, I knew about the <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/envelope-system-explained">Envelope Method</a>. I figured it would be a good place to start, but I knew there was no way I was going to make trips to the bank to withdraw cash. It had to be something I could manage with my card and my iPhone.</p>
<p>One thing you should know about me is that I‚Äôm <em>obsessed</em> with finding the <strong>One True Way</strong>‚Ñ¢ to do something. In the case of budgeting, I knew there had to be a system or method that worked better than any other. After more than a year of trial and error, I figured out a method that required the least effort and yielded the largest result. I also found an app that worked adequately with my method.
</p>

<p>Since I‚Äôm me, I was never satisfied with the app I was using. It was designed for someone else‚Äôs method and was more than what I needed. I was also convinced that <em>all</em> the apps in the App Store were more than what <em>most</em> people need.</p>

<h2>Desperately Seeking Software</h2>
<p>Over time, I became more frustrated with the app I was using. So I sat down and designed my ideal app. It looked like this:</p>

<figure>
<img class="figureimg" src="figures/1.png" width="100%">
<figcaption>Questionable signal/noise ratio. Also a questionable name. Also, looks like a 10-year-old app.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>One of the first things I did was to start capturing and articulating the method that was working so well for me. Before I began designing the UI, I spent time thinking about the rules/principles that governed this method. Eventually, I would modify them but I knew that getting the method right was critical to the experience.</li>
  <li>My original style for the app was a clich√©. I based it on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currency+Guilloch√©&t=osx&ia=images&iax=images">currency guilloch√©</a> because <em>money</em>. üôÑ</li>
  <li>I knew from experience that this was a core design element of the app. The ability to have categories and category groups was essential.
  <li>The plus button element at the bottom is an interesting case study. I stuck with it much too long. I‚Äôll come back to that in a min.</li>
  <li>This ‚Äúequation‚Äù UI is a perfect example of overthinking something. I was trying to show the before and after effect of a budget change but it‚Äôs completely overdesigned and unnecessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I got the designs fleshed out, I reached out to my business partner, Adam and pitched the idea. I walked him through the method and the app and I suggested we build it as a team.</p>
<p>Adam was not interested. He wasn‚Äôt into budgeting and so he wasn‚Äôt excited enough to work on it. I figured that was that.</p>

<h2>The Inverted Tope Reversal</h2>

<p>Almost a year went by and I got a call from Adam one day. He had questions about budgeting and wanted to know how I budgeted. He was dealing with the same overspending struggles I had. So I explained the method to him again and pitched the app once more. This time, it had the weight of context and he was 100% on board. So, of course, the first thing I did was start redesigning the app. I hadn‚Äôt looked at it in months and when I was walking through it with him, all kinds of issues were glaring to me.</p>

<p>But before I talk about the many iterations we went through, I think it will help to explain how the app works.</p>

<figure>
<img class="figureimg" src="figures/2.png" width="100%">
<figcaption>These three screens are around getting the budget set up</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>First, the user gets their ‚Äúincome‚Äù into the system so it can be budgeted. Starting with a total like this makes it so as people budget, they don‚Äôt have to do the math. Filthy Rich does that for them.</li>
  <li>This is the "Add Income" screen where the user adds that bulk income amount.</li>
  <li>The user then taps on each of the categories and moves money from the income to the category.</li>
</ol>

<figure>
<img class="figureimg" src="figures/3.png" width="100%">
<figcaption>These three screens are for tracking spending and making category changes</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>This button invokes the screen to ‚Äútrack spending.‚Äù We also made a ‚Äúlong press‚Äù gesture on a category to automatically select that category. The ‚Äúrecord spending‚Äù action is a key aspect of the Filthy Rich method. There are some budgeting apps like Mint and others that track spending for you. We have found that tracking spending is critical to getting spending under control. And it has to be done manually. You can‚Äôt turn it over to a machine.</li>
  <li>This was an unfortunate aspect of this design that I didn‚Äôt love. Even with the long-press, it seemed weird to have a big part of the UI devoted to something that should have been obvious. More on this in a minute.</li>
  <li>This shows two swipe gestures, one for transferring money and one for deleting a category. We changed the latter after some user testing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ALLOW MYSELF TO INTRODUCE MYSELF</h2>

<p>Looking at the design with fresh eyes, I could see that the signal-to-noise ratio was off. I realized I didn‚Äôt need as much UI chrome as I thought. It was also obvious to me how tired and clich√© the style looked. I needed to find a brand and UI aesthetic that was more in harmony with the goals and vision I had for the app.</p>

<p>One thing I knew for sure was that a key to the app was in the fluidity and ease of capturing spending. I also wanted the brand to have more personality. I needed to find the true essence of the app. I needed to find its soul.</p>

<figure>
<img class="figureimg" src="figures/4.png" width="100%">
<figcaption>Some of the brand explorations I did</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As I started working on the brand identity, I played with other symbols of wealth. I explored royal imagery and found I liked using a royal purple as the core color. I don‚Äôt see very many purple apps and thought it might stand out in a sea of blue.</p>

<p>Using an obvious royal symbol like a crown wasn‚Äôt working. Instead, I explored going over-the-top with some bourgeoisie imagery. I designed a monocled, mustachioed ‚Äúrich guy‚Äù icon instead and immediately loved it. I also landed on the name ‚ÄúFilthyRich‚Äù which further pushed the theme of upper-class absurdity. I also liked that the name focused on the aspirational state of the customer. Even if the identity is absurd, we still want to help people build wealth and financial security. So being aspirational in name seemed right to me. We went back-and-forth a few times on whether the name should be two separate words or smashed together. In testing the smashed version, we found problems with Siri. So we were forced to use a two-word name. But in the logo, I reduced the space between the words so that it almost looks like one word.</p>

<p>As I played with color, I also looked for ways to make it feel even richer and more saturated. I added a splash of gold, which really made it shine. I loved the idea of an ostentatious brand with a laser-focused, almost austere UI. So I started focusing on the UI next.</p>

<h2>Let‚Äôs get down to the nitty-gritty</h2>

<p>This was the start of an obsessive degree of removing the unessential. We always try to do this in our apps, but with Filthy Rich, we definitely became more aware of it than ever. Every time we removed or simplified something, it made the app that much better.</p>

<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You can see that the ‚Äúrecord spend‚Äù button is still here in this iteration.</li>
  <li>Selecting all the button shapes and deleting them in my design app was deeply satisfying. Numbers on their own worked well enough.</li>
  <li>I brought over the ‚Äúequation‚Äù UI but after removing the number button chrome, it was clear that this was too complex.</li>
  <li>Instead of the equation, adding ‚Äúnew amount‚Äù under the field amount accomplished the same goal. It let people see the result of the adjustment they were making, but without all the extra chrome.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>I created a clickable prototype to start doing user testing with the new designs. You can see a newer version of the prototype I used <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/gTRsaE4R2EKAycMtiCJBjGbU/filthyrich?node-id=1638%3A278&viewport=91%2C606%2C0.24276596307754517&scaling=min-zoom">here</a>. I found that even though it was standard practice in iOS to have the save/cancel buttons at the top of the UI, people were still looking for them at the bottom.</li>
  <li>Here I started playing with using a simpler ‚Äúcaret‚Äù style for the backspace action. More on this later.</li>
  <li>I moved the save and cancel buttons to the bottom but it increased the ratio of noise-to-signal.</li>
  <li>I played with using a single ‚Äúdelete‚Äù function instead of a backspace. But wiping out the number and making them start over had the effect of throwing them off their flow.</li>
  <li>Moving the backspace up into the field freed up space in the keypad for the save and cancel buttons. This tested well.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>As I began to design the settings screens (not covered in this article), I added some illustrations. To complement them, I also added some icons in the same style to the home/intro screen.</li>
  <li>We continued to refine the 5 points of the budgeting method. Before, the first item was ‚Äúeliminate debt.‚Äù We found that while very important, debt elimination was a whole other discipline. The focus of Filthy Rich needed to stay on budgeting. Adam also made a pitch for replacing that section with a section around goal setting. I realized that goal setting <em>was</em> part of my process but that I had never really articulated it. So we added, ‚ÄúSet a BHAG‚Äù which I later changed (as you‚Äôll see).</li>
  <li>I wanted to continue refining the eggagerated branding. So I asked Adam if we could ‚Äúmake it rain‚Äù with the icons and move them to the top. He was enthusiastic in adding this completely superfluous animation.</li>
  <li>We‚Äôve gone back and forth on adding a note that lets the user know when a sync is complete. This was one iteration of how that might work. It would be a small message that would appear and then fade out over a couple of seconds. We will likely add this at some point but probably in a different location in the UI.</li>
  <li>The ‚Äúrecord spend‚Äù button (I need a better name for this vestigial button) is still here. As I performed user testing, it was clear that the plus button <img src="figures/plusbutton.png" class="figinline"> I had before was super confusing. In hindsight, I feel dumb for not picking a different icon. I would learn later that this new ‚Äúshopping‚Äù icon didn‚Äôt address what was a more fundamental issue.</li>
</ol>

<h2>A designer and a developer walk into a bar</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm not the kind of designer that is protective about the role of design. If I had my way, everyone on a software team would be design-minded. Heck, everyone in any company should be a designer. The more design thinking in an organization, the better. The more focus on the customer experience, the better. So it‚Äôs always unsurprising for me when some of the best UX solutions come from developers. Adam is one of those developers. He cares deeply about the customer experience. He has told me on many occasions that he doesn‚Äôt care about time spent refactoring UI. That it‚Äôs as important as any other work.</p>
<p>So one day Adam approached me with the solution that fixed the weirdness in the user testing that I was seeing. It also eliminated the need to even have the plus button for recording a spend. Here‚Äôs a screenshot of our exchange and my resulting design, based on his idea:</p>

<figure>
<img class="figureimg" src="figures/8.png" width="100%">
<figcaption>Now this is what I'm talking about.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>One of the best things about this new UI is it completely eliminated the need to ever pick a category for the two most common actions. This was a breath of fresh air.</li>
  <li>The left caret/arrow I had before was confusing. Some people thought it was going to slide the UI left somehow. People thought it meant something other than ‚Äúbackspace.‚Äù So I replaced it with the standard iOS backspace icon and the problems disappeared.</li>
  <li>I added a <em>not very subtle</em> color shift that really helped guide the user in testing. I also like to think that it has a small psychological effect. Perhaps the red makes spending feel like a negative thing and will help curb overspending.</li>
</ol>

<p>A note about user testing: I‚Äôm a gregarious person and don‚Äôt mind approaching people in public places and asking for their help. For Filthy Rich, I did a fair amount of testing with friends and family. But I also went to local stores and petitioned total strangers for their help. Everyone I met was super friendly and helpful. I love living in a small town.</p>

<p>The following is the text exchange I had with Adam the next day after testing a <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/gTRsaE4R2EKAycMtiCJBjGbU/filthyrich?node-id=1467%3A85&viewport=-129%2C817%2C0.46939489245414734&scaling=min-zoom">clickable prototype</a> of the new UI:</p>

<figure>
<img class="figureimg" src="figures/9.png" width="100%">
<figcaption>We were pretty stoked by now. It was exciting to see peoples‚Äô responses to what we were building. We also talked about the core principles of the design.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Wherein I get to the point</h2>

<p>Products have a soul. Naturally, I don't mean this in a metaphysical way. I mean it in a practical way.</p>
<p>Products reflect the attitudes and values of those that create them.</p>
<p>Sometimes those values are obvious, sometimes not. Sometimes the values are <em>intentional</em> and sometimes they are subconscious. But they‚Äôre always there.</p>
<p>As we‚Äôve built Filthy Rich, I‚Äôve come to a realization. Adam and I always design and build things with solid values or principles in mind. But we <em>rarely</em> articulate them and refine them the way we have with this app.</p>
<p>In writing this article, I‚Äôve realized just how much my latest thinking about UX has influenced my design choices. I‚Äôve also realized how great it is that after many years of doing this, there‚Äôs always more to learn.</p>
<p>The following are the core values that drive the development of Filthy Rich, in no particular order.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It‚Äôs important to design <em>opinionated</em> software. Making your software so the user can configure it how they want is usually a mistake. Instead, put in the time to experiment with different approaches. Find the design that works best for most people.</li>
  <li>Keep removing elements from your design until you have only the most essential. You‚Äôll be surprised by what you can do without.</li>
  <li>The first principle, specific to Filthy Rich is that you can‚Äôt automate budgeting. The act of recording what you spend is the magic key to helping you get a handle on your spending. There are apps that connect to your bank account and show you what you‚Äôve spent. But automatic tracking isn‚Äôt as powerful for changing behavior.</li>
  <li>Manual tracking is critical. So it‚Äôs also critical to make the tracking process as easy and painless as possible. This is one of the main reasons we‚Äôve removed so much noise from the app. If we remove any barriers to manual tracking, then it can become a habit.</li>
  <li>User testing is absolutely essential.</li>
</ol>

<h2>After and before and after</h2>

<p>Here are a couple more screenshots and notes. These are the designs that we‚Äôre shipping for version one, as well as some before and after screens.</p>

<figure>
<img class="figureimg" src="figures/10.png" width="100%">
<figcaption>These are the final designs that we're shipping in V1</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Screenshot Notes:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The edit button occupied a location that was too prominent. So I moved it to the bottom and de-emphasized it by making it a text link without any button chrome. Also, you‚Äôll notice that we removed the lines between the categories. This is another example of how you can remove something and make the experience better.</li>
  <li>This is the first time in this article that I‚Äôm showing how we handle the editing of categories.</li>
  <li>I added a way for people to be able to clear the income and start over if they fat-fingered the amount. I didn‚Äôt need to do testing on this since I did it myself a few times. This is one of many advantages of being a daily user of your own software.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The end</h2>

<p>This was a long read. I hope it was valuable to designers and others who are interested in the process of software design. And of course, we‚Äôre not done with the app. Heck, we‚Äôre just getting started. But we‚Äôre also proud of what we‚Äôve built so far.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know if Filthy Rich will be a financial success or not. But it also doesn‚Äôt keep me up at night. Building it was a labor of love. We built it for us but we also designed it to benefit others. Being financially in control has a material impact on peoples‚Äô quality of life. We hope people get as much benefit from budgeting as we have. We also hope to inspire those who design and build software. Think about the values you impart to your work. Consider the soul of your software.</p>
